# A-Maze-D

A-Maze-D is a project in which robots must find their way in a maze.

---

## 🧠 Description

Each robot must find an end of the current maze. The difficulty is that only one robot can be present in a maze's node, meaning that we have to prevent traffic jams and redirect them when possible.
